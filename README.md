# Learn To Cube Log
This is where you will log your progress in learning to cube

## Instructions
1. Learn to Cube!
- Choose a cube 2x2 or 3x3
- Pick a resource to learn from: 
    [YouCanDoTheCube](https://www.youcandothecube.com/solve-it/2-x-2-solution). 
    [Algorithm List](http://www.tecspy.com/mick/2x2x2.pdf)
    
2. Log your progress
- Create a Project board, use **basic kaban**
- Use the project board to show your progress in learning
- Add one more column: **Can Do**, for a list of things you can do if asked. (i.e. solve a 2x2 in under 60 seconds)
- At the end of each period fill out the log **this will be what you are being marked on**

3. Curricular Objectives
- design and write algorithms and subprograms to solve a variety of problems 
- describe and use modular programming concepts and principles in the creation of
computer programs;
- analys ealgorithms for their effectiveness in solving a problem
- demonstrate the ability to apply modular design concepts in computer programs

4. Guidance on how you will be marked on this:
- Some evidence will receive a level 1.
- To achive a level 2 you will need substantial evidence.
- To achive level 3:
  1. 3 goals must be achieved (You define your goals: i.e. solving in a certain time)
  2. All logs must be filled out
  3. Reflections must included refences to algorithms learnt and your understanding of them (i.e. first layer, second layer, face, OLL, PLL, etc.)
  
- To achieve level 4:
  1. All of level three must be complete
  2. There must be explicit mathematical connections to your learning of the cube demonstrated in each log.(**Even if it is retrospective**)
